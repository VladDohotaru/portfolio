Come up with better title. Tell the story of how I got into software development, starting with Java class I took in high school, and on to writing programs on my graphing calculator to "cheat" on tests by storing equations and running equations for physics, in high school.
Then go into writing the paypal module for my clan and taking more Java and C classes on program design, and how I worked at a computer store and attempted a shopping cart (using OS commerce?). And then onward to my first real job working at a start up, of a basic mostly CRUD application (define CRUD), and worked up from there.
