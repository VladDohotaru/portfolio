    <p>I have the hardest time with creative writing. Producing a continuous flow of words should be easier than this.</p>

<p>Even now, I’m tempted to spin that previous sentence around in my head over and over, thinking about how I could word it better, or how I could make the point more creatively.</p>

<p>But you know what? I won’t! Because it states exactly my point, and it’s fine the way it is.</p>

<p>I feel like I have tons of ideas, bouncing from one thought to another, making intuitive leaps, and it is just a challenge to get it written down. By the time I’m half way through a sentence, I’ve already made several parallel branches in my head of new possibilities I want to go to.</p>

<p>And by the time I finally get something together, I run it through the ol’ meat grinder over and over again, before scrapping it. What a chore!</p>

<p>It almost feels like being lost in the woods, constantly backtracking, doubting where I am going.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.</p>

  <p><span>— Ernest Hemmingway</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thinking, on the other hand, comes naturally. I can get lost in thought for great gulfs of time. But putting those thoughts into concise sentences in writing is always a challenge. For some reason, it’s much easier to do it in real time whilst babbling out words to a person directly with my mouth.</p>

<p>The only writing I am used to is technical writing, where specificity and clarity is key. Creative writing is much more challenging. And to a logic-worshiping creature such as myself that always sees the world through a lens of rationality, it is fairly easy to visualize what I am trying to accomplish with technical writing. This is not so with creative writing.</p>

<p>With technical writing, the outline, structure, and details sort of just materialize on their own. I guess this is because is all makes perfectly logic sense up front in the first place, and my job at that point is to communicate it clearly.</p>

<p>This is very different than communicating creatively.</p>

<p>With creative writing, I find myself endlessly polishing, rewording, and tweaking what I write, which turns writing into an ordeal for me. I end up with a jumbled mess of ideas scattered around, before thinking up more topics of blog posts I suddenly become passionate about and move onto.</p>

<p>Seriously, I must have like a dozen unfinished posts now.</p>

<p>So instead of applying my tried-and-true technical writing approach to creative writing, I’m trying something new. I’m writing in near stream-of-conscious. And I’m not going to go back and doubt every little word in every sentence.</p>

<p>I’m currently reading the diary of Anne Frank. For a young teenager scribbling away in a diary that she probably thought nobody would ever read, she sure is an excellent writer. And a creative one at that.</p>

<p>In fact, she writes better than most blog I’ve seen. I’m not sure if it’s because she wasn’t overthinking it, of if she just had a unique combination of maturity, individuality, and intelligence for her age, or if she was a natural-born writer who would’ve blossomed into a successful writing career had she survived into adulthood..</p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p>.. ok, back. From a sudden Anne Frank <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wiki%20spiral">Wikipedia spiral</a>. Anyways, I wish I could write as easily as Anne Frank.</p>

<p>Moving along though, I have a great interest in writing. Not my writing, gods no. But in the writing of others. Introspective perception is what it’s all about for me.</p>

<p>Reading is one of my favorite pastimes, and one thing I really appreciate is all the little nuances authors go through in their writing; the way they spin words and play with them, the sort of imagery they invoke, and the chain reaction of thought they’re able to trigger with the shortest of sentences.</p>

<p>Underground and 90’s gangster rappers excel in this regard, exceptionally so.</p>

<p>So let’s see here. I’ve managed to jump topics from writing perfectionism, to technical writing and thinking, to all my unfinished posts, to Anne Frank, to books, and then to rappers.</p>

<p>And I’m ok with that. Perhaps it’s better this way.</p>

<p>And hey, that was actually pretty fun that time.</p>
